Welcome to my project:    BLACK JACK

Why Black Jack?
I chose to build the card game black jack as my first project as a software engineering student because of the complexity involved to win a hand. I want to test and apply what I have learned thus far. Additionally, I am a fan of the Netflix show Ozark. This show immediately popped into my mind when I decided Black Jack would be my first endeavor.
