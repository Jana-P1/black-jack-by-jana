## Why Black Jack?

I chose to build the card game black jack as my first project as a software engineering student because of the complexity involved to win a hand. I want to test and apply what I have learned thus far. 

Also, I am a fan of the Netflix show Ozark which immediately popped into my mind when I decided Black Jack would be my first endeavor.

### Description
+ The program executes in two stages:
  1. Player stage
  2. Dealer stage
+ To imitate the feel of an actual game, the dealer plays its hand once the player clicks the **STAY** button.
### Pseudo Code
+ At the start, each are dealt 2 cards:
  + **Player**: 2 cards face up
  + **Dealer**: 1st card face down and 2n card face up
+ To draw additional cards, click **HIT**
+ When satisfied with your hand, click **STAY**
