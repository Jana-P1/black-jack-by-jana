## Why Black Jack?

I chose to build the card game black jack as my first project as a software engineering student because of the complexity involved to win a hand. I want to test and apply what I have learned thus far. 

Also, I am a fan of the Netflix show Ozark which immediately popped into my mind when I decided Black Jack would be my first endeavor.
